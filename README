Very easy way to try out software without polluting /usr/local

1) configure && make && install with --prefix=/usr/local/pkg/foo-0.99
2) stow -t /usr/local /usr/local/pkg/foo-0.99

Remove it:

3) stow -t /usr/local -u /usr/local/pkg/foo-0.99

Like gnu stow, my stow only affects symlinks, but it doesn't try to be
clever about verifying the source of a symlink or consolidate directories.
